## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rich-and-morty.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd rich-and-morty
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (default Vite port).

5. **Build the project for production:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

6. **Preview the production build:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn preview
   ```

   This will start a local server to preview the production build.

## Scripts

- **`dev`**: Starts the development server using Vite.
- **`build`**: Builds the application for production.
- **`lint`**: Runs ESLint to analyze code for potential errors and maintain code quality.
- **`preview`**: Previews the production build locally using Vite.

## Usage

After completing the installation steps:

1. **Run the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (default Vite port).

2. **Build for production:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   The optimized production build will be available in the `dist` directory.

3. **Preview the production build:**

   ```bash
